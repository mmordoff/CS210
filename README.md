Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Airgead Banking has requested a program be created to show users how their investment can potentially grow over time. The program must validate the users input, have a user friendly interface, display accurate numbers, and include industry best practices.

What did you do particularly well?
In order to succeed in writing this program, I had to break each down into parts and plan out my code. This helped me stay organized and on track to write  a successful program. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by adding more comments explaining my code. This project was lengthy and had a lot of various classes. I could also enhance my code by having less code in the main function.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this project was writing the code to have it flow together while maintaining organization. I spent a lot of time researching this project and reading Zybooks.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project gave me a better understanding of how to organize a project. This will serve as an example to me of how to successful write an organized, slightly more complex program. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In order to maintain readability for my code, I followed industry standards. I added in line comments to explain how my code worked for each line.
